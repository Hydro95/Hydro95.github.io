  <h1>Welcome to my little corner of the internet.</h1>
  <p>You can follow along here to see what I've worked on, things I'm doing, and other random thoughts. This site is running on Jekyll, and I'm currently learning how to set that up.</p>
  <p>At the moment I have no idea what direction I want the content to take, so in the future I'll probably organize the posts into some different topics. Most likely I'll be talking about whatever is interesting to me at the given moment, or whatever might be interesting to someone like you. I mean, you probably know how a blog works.

  <h2>In the mean time...</h2>
  <p>If I don't know you and you have discord, feel free to drop in to this server here and introduce yourself. I'm more than happy to chat about anything and everything!</p>
