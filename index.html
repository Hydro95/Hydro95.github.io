  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p class="meta"></p>
  <h2>Welcome, stranger, to my little corner of the internet.</h2>
  <p>You can follow along here to see what I've worked on, things I'm doing, and other random thoughts.</p>
  <p>This site is running on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>, which is a totally cool (and free) way to host the whole thing.</p>
  <p>Recently I've had an itch to do some creative writing so I've been getting it out of my system by writing a story for something I'm calling <i>2084 - Underground</i>. You can check it out <a href="https://hydro95.github.io/U2084/">here.</a>
  </p>
  <p>I don't have very much to show on the main page of this site yet, so go ahead and browse the tabs up top to see the beef.</p>
  <h2>In the mean time...</h2>
  <p>If I don't know you and you have discord, feel free to drop in to this server here and introduce yourself. I'd be more than happy to chat about anything and everything!</p>
