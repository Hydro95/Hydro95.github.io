  <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
  <p>Well, I do. Hopefully this page will give you some insight into who I am and what I'm all about.</p>
  <h2>Who?</h2>
  <p><img class='profilepic' src="/assets/images/josh.jpg"></img>My name is Joshua Vinge. In person, I go by "Josh" and on the internet I go by "Hydro" most commonly. I'm 19 years old and I'm currently studying at the University of Ottawa in my second year, for a BSc with Honours in Computer Science.</p>
  <h2>Stuff I've done</h2>
  <p>You can poke around at the source code for any of my repositories on my Github profile <a href="https://github.com/Hydro95">here.</a> Among these projects, I've:
    <ul class="styled">
      <li>Built the page you're viewing right now<li>
      <li>Created Discord bots using Javascript</li>
      <li>Developed a Twitter bot in Python</li>
      <li>Collaborated with fellow students on an Android chore-tracker app in Java</li>
      <li>Contributed to open source repos during this past October's Hackathon</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Other things you won't be able to find on my Github are:
    <ul class="styled">
      <li>My Android game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hydrodev.polyfighter">Polyfighter</a> using Gamemaker Studio 2</li>
      <li>My art gallery (yes, I do like to get creative!) (link pending while I set up a page for this)</li>
      <li>10,000 unfinished game prototypes from "the early years"</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h2>Stuff I want to do</h2>
  <p>Graduate! In all honesty, I love learning. Part of my drive going forward is knowing I'll be learning more about computer science and slowly uncovering the complex parts of what computers are. I'm always open to adopting new technologies and learning from experience.</p>
  <p>I also decided to start studying Japanese with the intent of reaching fluent levels. I enrolled in an introductory course during my first semester of second year and fell in love with learning a second language so I decided I would see it through to completion and dedicate time and effort to learning it. The biggest challenge is vocabulary for me at the moment, so I'm slowly improving my memorization skills. Learning a second language has been a great tool in teaching me how to look at problems from different angles.</p>
