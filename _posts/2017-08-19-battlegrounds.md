## Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!

To start things off on a bit of a more interesting topic, I want to talk about the popular battle royale game that has recently grabbed the attention of over 7 million people (and that's just on Steam).

You guessed it. I'm talking about [PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS](http://store.steampowered.com/app/578080/PLAYERUNKNOWNS_BATTLEGROUNDS/).

![Kaboom.](/assets/2017-08-19-battlegrounds/1.jpg)

Chances are, you've probably either had a chance to play it, seen a livestream or two, or heard about it through other gaming news, and that's for a good reason. This game is [getting big](http://steamspy.com/app/578080). But rather than talk about the "big" things surrounding this game, I want to focus more on some smaller things people might not know about. I'm assuming you're reading here for strategies, and if you haven't picked up the game yet, I would highly recommend it (you can pick it up from the Steam link above). This is somewhat of a personal trial and error report combined with a few strategies I've found online that will hopefully improve your game sense and increase your chances of scoring that sweet chicken dinner. Something to note is most of this info carries into each different game mode, however I've played solo the most and will be basing my knowledge on that mode.

## Let's take it from the top.

If you're looking to finish right, you're going to have to start right. Bad habits can be hard to reverse, but if you haven't set them in stone yet, you'd better get practicing the proper way from the start! If you're just starting out, or even if you've been playing for a few weeks, there's a huge resource of quality information on [WackyJacky101](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfK7qpS954pk14YvDCsWCuw)'s Youtube channel that will take you through tips on setting up your game right to suggesting aiming improvements and all around gameplay enhancements. Seriously. Go watch those videos. I learned the game is far more complex than I previously had thought. Those videos were actually one of the main inspirations for writing this post: I want to share what I know to hopefully improve your journey too.

## Well, I checked out that channel. Now what?

Channel? Come again? If you skipped that paragraph, go back and read it. This is a long read and if you can't sit through one paragraph you might have a bad time with this post. But it's worth it. Anyways, let's begin.

### What should I do before I start?

![fiddle with the options.](/assets/2017-08-19-battlegrounds/2.jpg)

My suggestion is making sure you check out the options menu to brush up on the keybindings and set up any graphics options to fit the abilities of your computer.

Once you start to play and pick up a few clothing crates you should try to equip darker clothes that don't stand out very much since you'll be able to hide in the shadows easier. I've been selling my crates on the Steam Market and then buying the clothing items I want with those funds to take out the random gamble at bad clothes.

![get some swag.](/assets/2017-08-19-battlegrounds/3.jpg)

### What should I do when I join the game?

Like most other strategy guides I've read through, one of the first tips is to use the spawn island to get yourself familiar. If you've never played, hit M to open up your map and take a look at the place. You'll get to know the area well enough as you play more.

If you're not playing right now and want to take a look at the map, check out [pubgmap.io](https://pubgmap.io/) for an interactive map.

#### I'm here early, and there's a lot of guns.

Hopefully you spawn in early before everyone takes all the weapons and you get a chance to warm up your aim. Try to take weapons you haven't tried before or are not very familiar with. Widening your knowledge of how to use each weapon effectively is an incredibly valuable skill, as you're not guaranteed your favorite gun every time you play.

![the gun tables](/assets/2017-08-19-battlegrounds/5.jpg)

I suggest you try to prioritize a few of the commonly dropped ground weapons to practice with, such as the UMP/Micro Uzi or the M16/AKM. Reason being you're going to find them the most so you'd better get comfortable with them. Taking any of those weapons to the end is definitely possible. Try to avoid pistols and shotguns or melee weapons since they're not of much use as soon as you find stronger weapons with better range. Shotguns may be an exception to this (namely the S12K for the mag reload) because of their high damage when in close quarters. Usefulness of these weapons may change in the future, but as of right now I rarely use them beyond my first few houses.

When you secure a weapon, try it out in a few imaginary situations. There's probably about a hundred other people running around at this point, so you have a lot of free practice targets. Try hitting people at range that are standing on top of the crashed plane. Try hitting people that are moving away from you/perpendicular to you. What you're looking for is the cloud of blood that signifies a hit on your target. PUBG simulates a pretty realistic weapon experience and each gun has a unique shot velocity and range.

If you really want to improve your aim, and haven't seen this video by WackyJacky101, check it out. He does a brilliant job at explaining range and where to aim.

#### I'm here, but there's no guns left. Now what?

You can still practice, don't worry! Head over to the crashed plane and try to parkour your way up on top of the major parts. You can also head over to the shipping containers that are close by and practice jumping over the gaps. The faster you can land where you wanted to land, the more prepared you'll be when you have to make a quick escape in a real situation. Personally, I don't play many third person games so it took me a little bit of time to get used to the way the camera works in relation to the player. Once you get the moving down and are looking to try the first-person-only mode, you might have to relearn how to move around anyways, as it puts an interesting twist on making your way around (more on that later).

![the shipping containers](/assets/2017-08-19-battlegrounds/6.jpg)

### Oh, I'm in a plane now.

It's loud, and it's moving fast! Right away you're going to want to open up your map and determine the flight path of the plane. It's going to intersect the map at a random angle and location every time you play, so you'll get a fairly fresh start each game. If you haven't visited a specific place you can plan your landing there, or if you're more familiar with a certain area, by all means land there. Right clicking the map places a marker down for you so you don't miss your landing or forget where you're headed.

#### But where should I land?

This is something I've considered for a long time since playing. The trouble is there's no definite answer that fits everyone's playstyle, so you're just going to have decide for yourself. I can provide a few pointers though.

#### I like to pretend I'm Rambo and kill tons of people fast

If you're looking for high risk for a high reward, check to see if your flight path intersects any major cities or landmarks. Dropping in any of those places will guarantee running into at least one other person at some point. Cities provide lots of loot so they draw in quite a few players. Dropping into a city that's farther in the flight path is a "safer" option, since in most cases people will drop out at the first big loot target, or one near the center of the map.

Visit places like major cities, the school, the prison, or the military base.

![high loot areas](/assets/2017-08-19-battlegrounds/7.png)

The areas in yellow and red are places that players are likely headed to because of their higher loot spawns.

#### I like to avoid crazed people that want to kill me

If your playstyle is based around being a sneaky scavenger, you might opt to land somewhere off the beaten path. Hopefully you've picked a spot far enough away from the flight path that someone didn't pick the same house as you. Single houses directly below the flight path are often being picked by other people because of convenience, so try to skydive to a location perpendicular to the flight path of the plane. Be careful, because if you pick a place too secluded you might not find very good loot fast enough.

Visit locations outside of major cities to avoid other players for a chance to live longer.

### Okay, I'm on the ground and I'm very scared.

Before entering any houses, you should already be listening to hear any footsteps inside the building you're entering, and scanning your immediate surroundings for people landing nearby. If you can avoid instant threats this early in the game you have a better chance at making it to the second circle. If you spot someone <i> very </i> close by, make sure you're the first one to a weapon. Worst case you're going to have to win a fist fight if they decide to engage.

Hopefully you found some decent guns, a helmet, and maybe even a backpack or bullet proof vest. You should have noticed weapons on the ground always have no ammo, so if you drop a gun or pick one up you should reload it right away (given you're in a safe position) or you might be hearing clicking when you should be hearing shooting. If you've got multiple weapons try to make sure none of them share a common type of ammo or you might run out if you're expecting to use both. If you find a decent rifle or two and have a good amount of ammo you can usually skip on picking up a pistol to save some backpack space, as I've never found myself in a situation where a pistol was of use to me after having a rifle, but your mileage may vary.

![ideal inventory](/assets/2017-08-19-battlegrounds/9.jpg)

Make sure you equip any gun parts you find and toss duplicates or un-needed items. If you don't have enough weapons to put all your scopes on, that's okay, because you could be engaging targets at different ranges. Avoid cluttering your backpack so you can see the essential items faster, and deny others free loot if they happen to kill you. If you have a lot of things to drop, get rid of them while on the run and away from houses, as they're less likely to found by other players. If you can put everyone else at a disadvantage, you can indirectly put yourself at an advantage.

### I'm now on the move.

![on the ground](/assets/2017-08-19-battlegrounds/8.jpg)

In most cases you're either going to have to start moving to the location of the next circle, or finding a safe location to hunker down if you're already in it. Remember the flight path of the plane? Knowing where players are likely to be is very important while travelling around. This skill not only requires vision, but sound and common sense. I try to put myself in the shoes of someone else: What houses are close by? What direction do I need to run towards to get inside the next circle? If you can figure out where there may be other players, you can plan to ambush them or avoid an unnecessary fight.

#### Visual Cues

In most cases it's fairly easy to spot where someone has been. You may see an open door or a misplaced vehicle, or even a loot box from a dead player. Depending on how close the edge of the circle is from your location, the place could have been cleared long ago or may have someone still lurking nearby. Always approach new places with caution and be ready to fight anyone that may appear.

#### Audio Cues

Sound is one of the most essential tools you can use to figure out where people are and what they're doing. You might decide to avoid somewhere you can hear gunshots being fired from, or have to take cover if you hear a vehicle approaching. A cargo plane will periodically travel across the map to release cargo drops with valuable loot, but also offers a lot of noise to mask your gunshots. In close quarters you can hear footsteps and doors to warn you other players are very close by, and to prepare for combat if they see you.

#### Other Cues

While not as obvious as the physical evidence listed above, there are other indicators that could be inferred as to the location of others. Players are likely to located somewhere within skydiving distance of the original flight path of the plane. If you're entering the circle take caution as others that are entering might stop right at the edge to wait for any other unsuspecting runners and take them out. Know that locations with lots of potential loot will attract many other players. If you're near open fields, there are likely a few people waiting in a building nearby for someone to cross in the open for an easy kill. Keep an eye on hills where others might try to get a height advantage over you, and be careful of people hiding in bushes or behind trees. Never let your guard down because you feel like you're the only one around.

### I'm still alive and there's now around 40 players.

Congrats! You've made it past the first half of survival and maybe even racked up a few kills. But buckle down. 95% of the effort happens in the last 5% of the game, so you still have a long way to go.

### What should I be doing when raiding houses?

If you're looking for better loot or more bandages, the best place (and the only place if you can't find a supply drop) to look is in houses or other buildings. However, this isn't a chicken dinner party (yet!) so you're going to have to pay attention before entering.

#### Rule 1: NEVER expose yourself

This rule involves your physical placement and noise level. If you're outside the house, do a small perimeter check if you suspect someone might be inside. Check for broken windows, players hiding in corners, and open doors inside the house. If you spot a player you can toss a stun grenade to get an advantage over them if they don't expect your entry, but be fast enough that they can't fight you back.

![always look before you go](/assets/2017-08-19-battlegrounds/12.jpg)

 If you need to enter a room, do it military breach style and position yourself to the side of the door and use the camera to peek in to check for any hiding threats. You'll save yourself a face full of lead and possibly even force the person inside to make the first move of exposing themselves. Many houses have enough space behind an open door to hide behind so <b>NEVER</b> forget to check behind an open door for a player. I've killed many people by baiting them into an open room by hiding behind the door and striking them when they least expect it. If you have to lean to peak around the corner, you can get a few extra feet of view depending on the size of the room.

 ![breaching a room](/assets/2017-08-19-battlegrounds/13.jpg)

If you're travelling around and suspect there may be someone nearby, make use of your walk button and slow your movement. Muffling your movement sounds makes the other player have to guess where you are and gives you an advantage if they don't sense you coming. Walking at normal speed and sprinting causes lots of noise and it's easy to pinpoint the location of another player based on sound alone.

#### Rule 2: ALWAYS practice good crosshair placement

One of the biggest mistakes is not knowing where to aim and being caught by surprise without being ready to fight back. If you're rolling around looking at your feet, or checking out the walls inside a house, you might as well be running blind. Keep your crosshair focused on areas where enemies could pop out of like door frames or tops of stairs, and always try to be the first to shoot if there's immediate danger. Give them no room to set up their aim on you and you'll have the advantage.

#### Rule 3: ALWAYS be aware of the trail you're leaving

To someone passing by, they could be making use of the advice above and notice open doors or other things that give away your position. Use this to your advantage. Keeping all doors closed while you raid a house will tell others around you the house has fresh loot and will entice them to enter. Open doors will warn others people have been here and they may avoid the house. You can bamboozle players by baiting them into a "fresh" house while hiding behind the spot the door opens into to take them by surprise and grab their loot, or have others avoid a set of houses by intentionally leaving the doors open. Your strategy for baiting or avoiding players is up to you in this case.

![good hiding spot](/assets/2017-08-19-battlegrounds/14.jpg)

You can see out, They can't see in.

![good hiding spot feet position](/assets/2017-08-19-battlegrounds/15.jpg)

Here's where your feet should be. Be careful that none of your gear clips through the wall/door or they might see you.

### I've played a few rounds and I've finally made it into the top 20.

This is where the game becomes more complex. If you've been avoiding combat most of the time it's going to become a lot harder to avoid it now as there's going to be a higher concentration of players near you. If you've managed to stay inside the circles and keep yourself positioned well, you have a good shot at making it into the last 10 players. Keep yourself near the edge of the circle to avoid being flanked, but make sure you don't step outside the circle for very long: this is the point in the game where the circle starts to hurt you a lot and you generally won't survive more than 15 seconds outside of it.

![nearing the end](/assets/2017-08-19-battlegrounds/10.jpg)

Unless the final few circles are positioned awkwardly, in most cases you'll be forced into combat because there will be no more cover. I've watched games where the last person won simply because the circle was placed in their favor and everyone else died outside of it. If you can help it, keep trying to conceal your position and only fire if you can confirm kills and keep yourself hidden.

### The final circle

This is it. The moment you've been waiting for. You're within the last remaining 3 or so people, and adrenaline levels are through the roof. Any small mistake could steal away your victory, so play carefully, and play well. When I find myself in this position I tend to be the one that waits to see what the other two will do. If they start to engage each other, be ready to take out the winner of the fight straight away before he can recover and reload any of his weapons or bandage himself. If you're being engaged, make sure the third individual has no angle on you or your attacker could leave your position exposed.

## The end?

If you made it through this guide, applied what you learned and won, congratulations! You seriously beat the odds and earned your chicken dinner.

![close! But not today.](/assets/2017-08-19-battlegrounds/11.jpg)

Or something like this happens.

But if you failed, keep trying again and don't give up. This game requires tons of practice and even more patience. You shouldn't go in expecting to win every time, you should go in expecting to <b>learn</b>. I'm hoping in the future the devs include some more info after you die (at least for solo mode) such as a kill cam or some information about your attacker so you can use your death as a learning experience for next time. Always evaluate what you could have done better in a situation, and act on it again for the next time. You're bound to improve if you learn from your own mistakes, but hopefully I've covered enough that you can learn from my experience as well.

Good luck out there!
